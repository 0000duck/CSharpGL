# Dependent Actions
Dependent actions are actions that work together to accomplish something. They cannot construct a single meaningful action alone.
# Simplest Rendering Action
A simplest rendering action consists of two actions:
## Transform Action
Transform action updates objects rotation, scale and translation states in the scene.
## Render Action
Render action renders objects to screen.
# Rendering with Shadow-mapping
Rendering with shadow-mapping is a list of `TransformAction`, `ShadowMappingAction` and `RenderAction`.
